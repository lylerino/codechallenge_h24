Thank you for trying out the pangram checker!

Q: What is a pangram? 
A: A pangram is a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet at least once.

This code can find out if a sentence is a pangram or not and help you write a pangram by telling you which letters are missing from a sentence in order for it to be pangram.

How to use:
1. Save the script to your computer
2. Right click the script and click "open with", then choose any code editor or just the regular windows editor
3. Scroll all the way down to line 40 that starts with var sentence = ""
4. Type any english sentence between the "" and save the script, do NOT use any characters from other languages or numbers in your sentence, this script is kind of monolingual ;)
5. Leave the editor open and open the script again as in step 1 but instead of opening it with an editor, open it in a web browser (eg Firefox, Chrome, IE explorer)
6. The browser should now show you if your sentence is a valid pangram!
7. You can change your sentence in the editor as many times as you like and after saving the changes, go to your browser and press F5 (refresh page) to see what the result for your input is
8. Have fun!
